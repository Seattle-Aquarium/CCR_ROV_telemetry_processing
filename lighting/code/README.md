# Lutris Lighting System

MicroPython code for the ROV lighting control subsystem. Runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350).

## Overview

Controls 4 [DeepSea Power & Light LED SeaLite](https://www.deepsea.com/portfolio-items/led-sealite/) lamps via a shared UART bus using the DSPL SeaSense protocol. Light brightness is controlled by a PWM signal from the BlueROV's servo output, allowing the pilot to dim lights with a joystick axis in Cockpit/QGroundControl.

Note that the SeaSense dimming curve is strongly non-linear — `LOUT` 60 buys only
15% of full output, and two thirds of the light lives in the top quarter of the
command range — so the linear PWM mapping in step 3 below is linear in *command
value*, not in light. See [`../simulation/`](../simulation/) for the measured
curve and what it means for exposure.

## How It Works

1. The BlueROV sends a standard servo PWM signal (1100-1900 us at ~50 Hz) to GP16 on the Pico
2. The Pico measures pulse width using pin edge interrupts
3. Pulse width is linearly mapped to brightness: 1100 us = 0% (off), 1500 us = 50%, 1900 us = 100%
4. Brightness commands are sent to all 4 lights over UART using the SeaSense protocol
5. If the PWM signal is lost for >1 second, lights turn off automatically

## Pin Assignments

| Pin  | Function                    |
|------|-----------------------------|
| GP0  | UART TX to SeaLite lights   |
| GP1  | UART RX from SeaLite lights |
| GP14 | I2C SDA (INA238 power monitor) |
| GP15 | I2C SCL (INA238 power monitor) |
| GP16 | PWM input from BlueROV servo output |

## BlueROV Setup

1. In BlueOS, configure a servo output as an actuator function (e.g., Servo 9)
2. In Cockpit/QGroundControl, map a joystick axis or button to that actuator
3. See the [Newton Gripper installation guide](https://bluerobotics.com/learn/newton-subsea-gripper-installation/#setup-in-qgroundcontrol) for the general pattern of configuring auxiliary servo outputs

## Development

Mount the local directory and test interactively:

```
cd lighting/code/src
mpremote mount . repl
```

Then in the REPL:

```python
from main import main
c = main()
# The PWM control loop starts automatically.
# Press Ctrl-C to stop the loop and use manual commands:
c.set_all_lights(50)
c.all_off()
c.read_power()
c.status()
```

## Deploy to Device

```
cd lighting/code/src
mpremote cp -r . :
mpremote reset
```

Once deployed, the system starts automatically on boot and requires no manual intervention.
