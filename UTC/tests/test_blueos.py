"""Asking the ROV what it offers.

This runs against a small fake BlueOS rather than a real vehicle, so it can
run in CI and on a desk. What it pins down is the behaviour that matters in
the field: the probe never raises, never writes to the vehicle, and reports
honestly when it cannot reach one — because a tool that throws a traceback on
a wet deck is worse than no tool.
