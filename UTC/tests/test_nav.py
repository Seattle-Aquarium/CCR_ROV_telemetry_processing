"""The rail: four chapters, in the order a survey day happens.

The grouping is the point. Eight rail entries had stopped describing anything;
four describe the day -- the boat, the desk, then the two kinds of media -- and
a chapter can grow another tool without the rail growing at all. These tests
pin that shape, because it is the sort of thing that erodes one convenient
addition at a time.

Needs a display, and skips without one.
