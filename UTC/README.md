# Underwater Telemetry Compositing (UTC)

**One program for a whole ROV survey day.** Pull the recordings off the vehicle,
prove they are sound, cut the telemetry into analysis-ready CSVs, sort and
develop the imagery, and build the video — from one window, on a field laptop,
with nothing else to install.

</p>

## Why this exists

The Seattle Aquarium's ROV survey method is not one technique, it is a chain:
fly the survey, get the recordings off the vehicle, prove they are intact, cut
the telemetry into per-transect CSVs, sort the stills, develop the raws,
composite the video. Every link in that chain existed here as its own thing — a
download by hand, an R script, a Python extractor, a Lightroom session driven
with a mouse, an ffmpeg incantation, and a folder convention that lived mostly
in one person's head.

Each piece worked. **The chain did not travel.** A group wanting to run these
surveys would have had to reassemble it from a repository and a conversation,
and the parts nobody had written down were exactly the parts that decide whether
the numbers mean anything: which clock a time is in, which sensor a depth came
from, what happens when a recording is truncated.

UTC is those pieces in one program, in the order a survey day happens:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Retrieve** | Ask the vehicle what it is and what it holds, check it is fit to dive, and copy the right recordings onto a drive you can carry home. |
| **Understand** | Cut the telemetry into per-transect CSVs, and say plainly when a recording, a clock or an instrument cannot be trusted. |
| **Photos** | Card to transect folder, raw development, telemetry banner. |
| **Video** | Per-transect trims, telemetry composites, and short clips for a talk. |

Two consequences, and both are the point.

**Nothing is typed twice.** The transect times entered once on the first screen
drive the CSVs, the imagery sorting, the dive-profile check and the video
overlays. Two copies of those times drifting apart is the kind of error that
only shows up when the analysis disagrees with the footage.

**It is one file.** A collaborator gets `Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe`
and double-clicks it. No Python, no ffmpeg, no fonts, no timezone database, no
build step.

The aim is that another organisation can pick this up and *run* the method
rather than approximate it. What is not automated is written down, and where a
number is an estimate rather than a measurement, the file says so.

## What it does

Four chapters on a left-hand rail, in the order a survey day happens. Each
carries its own tools along the top of its own page, so the rail stays four
items long however many tools accumulate.

| Chapter | Tool | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · Aboard ROV** | **Flight & transects** | Create a flight's folders, then enter its transect times once. Draws a dive profile with the transects marked, so a mistyped time is obvious before anything is processed. |
| | **Vehicle & files** | Ask BlueOS what the vehicle is, check it is fit to dive, and copy the right recordings onto a portable drive. [Read-only](#aboard-the-rov) — nothing on the ROV is written to or deleted. |
| | **Monitoring** | Record [the laptop](#monitoring-the-topside-while-it-flies) at 1 Hz and [the tether at 10](#the-tether-from-both-ends) for the length of a flight, and snapshot the vehicle's parameters and software versions at arming and disarming. Starts and stops itself with the ROV. Also checks the topside network before the dive, which is the one check that cannot be run afterwards. |
| **2 · Flight report** | **Flight summary** | Read the whole day back — every recording, the topside logs, the parameter snapshots — work out [what happened](#the-flight-report), and write a branded PDF that travels with the flight folder. |
| | **Transects** | Cut the `.mcap` telemetry into [one CSV per transect](#transects-mcap-to-csv), plus a map of the site, and [report how the navigation behaved](#sensor-health). |
| | **Recording health** | Check each `.mcap` for damage, repair the ones the vehicle never closed, and — [when a recording is beyond saving](#when-a-recording-fails) — read telemetry from the autopilot's own `.BIN` log instead. |
| **3 · Photos** | **Import photos** | Pull stills off the camera card straight into transect folders, renamed and bannered. Copies from a card; moves from inside the flight. |
| | **Process photos** | Develop a folder of GoPro `.GPR` raws through Lightroom Classic: crop to the survey size, remove chromatic aberration, AI Denoise, export 16-bit ProPhoto TIFs. |
| | **Banner tools** | Add the telemetry banner to any folder of stills, later. |
| **4 · Videos** | **Video** | Trim each transect out of the original 4K, build the telemetry composites, cut short shareable clips, and put two flights side by side. |

## What a composite carries

The downward-facing GoPro from one transect, with telemetry from the BlueOS
`.mcap` drawn along the top of the frame. One video per transect.

<p align="center">

</p>

The overlay strip, at full resolution:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/composite_overlay.png" width="920"
       alt="The overlay strip at full resolution: the ROV's forward-camera inset, a compass rose, a tilt indicator, and the telemetry panel." />
</p>

Left to right:

1. **The ROV's own forward camera**, pulled out of the same recording — what the
   pilot was looking at while the downward camera recorded the seabed.
2. **A compass rose and a tilt indicator**, stacked: heading, then pitch and
   roll.
3. **A telemetry panel** — altitude, speed, depth, flight mode, light power,
   thruster gain, camera tilt, water temperature, and power draw.

The right half of the frame is deliberately left clear. A footer along the
bottom carries project, site, transect and the UTC timestamp, so a frame lifted
out of context still says where and when it came from.

Every value is read from the recording at that instant rather than interpolated,
and held forward from the last sample only up to a staleness limit — a sensor
that drops out goes blank rather than flat, because [a dead instrument must not
look healthy](#the-flight-telemetry-csv).

Alongside the composites, the same run writes a **1 Hz telemetry CSV** for the
whole flight — see [the two CSVs](#the-two-csvs) for which file is which.

## Running it

### For collaborators: nothing to install

Hand them **`Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe`** and they double-click it.
There is nothing else to install — no Python, no ffmpeg, no fonts, no
timezone database. It is one self-contained file (~96 MB) carrying its own
copy of everything:

| bundled | why it has to be |
|---|---|
| Python 3.13 runtime | the whole point of the single file |
| ffmpeg (static) | every trim, composite and clip shells out to it |
| Montserrat | the Aquarium brand face, for the GUI and the photo banner |
| `tzdata` | Windows ships no IANA database, and without one every transect time resolves to the wrong instant |
| `pymavlink` | reads the autopilot's `.BIN` dataflash logs |
| `mcap`, `PyAV`, Pillow, NumPy, CustomTkinter | telemetry, video, imagery, GUI |
| the transect extractor, with pandas and SciPy | so the Transects page works from the executable, not only from source |
| `pywinauto` | AI Denoise has no scripting interface, so the RAW develop drives its panel through Windows UI Automation |

Requirements on their side:

* **Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.** The build is Windows-only; macOS or Linux
  would need its own build from the same spec.
* **Disk space.** The app is small but its working cache is not — reading one
  dive writes several GB per flight under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, and a 5 GB
  recording can produce ~12 GB of intermediates.
* **An NVIDIA GPU is optional.** UTC runs a two-frame trial encode to find out
  whether NVENC really works and falls back to the CPU encoder when it does
  not — it is a speed difference, not a requirement.
* **Lightroom Classic, for one tool only.** *Process photos* drives a real
  Lightroom installation — it is the only thing UTC cannot bring with it.
  Every other chapter works without it.
* **First launch shows a SmartScreen warning**, because the executable is not
  code-signed: *More info* → *Run anyway*. Tell partners to expect this, or it
  reads as the file being unsafe.

If a partner reports trouble, have them run the build's own health check:

```
Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe --selftest
```

It verifies the bundled ffmpeg, fonts and timezone database, that `pymavlink`
and the transect extractor import, and that overlay rendering really does run across processes — then
writes the result to `%TEMP%\utc_selftest.txt` for them to send on. A windowed
build discards stdout, so the file is the point.

The same build will also report what a vehicle offers, read-only, which is how
[the ROV side](#aboard-the-rov) gets built against what BlueOS actually serves
rather than against a guess:

```
Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe --probe-rov report.txt
```

### For development

Double-click **`run_UTC.bat`**. Nothing needs installing first beyond Python
3.10 or newer: on its first run the launcher builds a private environment in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\CCR_ROV\venv`, installs UTC and the transect extractor into it,
and starts the app. That takes a few minutes once; after that it opens straight
away.

The environment sits outside the repo deliberately — this checkout lives in a
OneDrive folder, and a virtualenv there would be thousands of files for the sync
client to chew through forever. `run_MCAP_to_CSV.bat` shares the same
environment, so whichever runs first does the work.

The launcher tests each Python it finds rather than taking the first one on
disk. A partial install still leaves a `python.exe` that cannot find its own
standard library, and choosing it produces a misleading `_tkinter` DLL error
rather than an obvious "this Python is broken".

From a terminal instead:

```
python -m pip install -e .
python -m utc.gui.app
```

`ffmpeg` does not need installing separately — the `imageio-ffmpeg` wheel ships
a static build. A real ffmpeg on `PATH` is used in preference if present.

### Building a standalone .exe

```
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller utc.spec
```

Produces `dist/Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe` (~96 MB), which needs no Python install
and can be handed to a colleague directly. Windows SmartScreen will warn about
an unsigned executable the first time: *More info* → *Run anyway*.

The build output is **git-ignored**; do not commit it.

Two things about the build worth knowing:

* The spec targets `launch.py`, not `utc/gui/app.py`. PyInstaller runs its
  target as `__main__`, so aiming it at the module breaks that module's relative
  imports (`attempted relative import with no known parent package`). A
  top-level script that imports the package keeps the package context intact.
* A windowed build discards stdout and stderr, so a startup failure leaves no
  trace whatsoever. Build a console variant to find out why:

  ```
  set COMPOSITE_DEBUG=1
  pyinstaller utc.spec
  dist\Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing-debug.exe
  ```

---

## Aboard the ROV

*Vehicle & files*, the second tool in chapter 1. It talks to BlueOS on the ROV's
Raspberry Pi over the tether, and it exists because three separate field
failures came from choosing recordings by hand: a flight whose covering
recording was never downloaded, a 6.7 GB file from a previous day pulled in
because BlueOS had rewritten its modification time, and a stray recording from
six weeks earlier sitting in a folder. UTC already knows the transect times and
can read an mcap's true span in well under a second, so it can pick the right
files itself.

> **Everything here is read-only.** GET requests only — no deletes, no writes to
> the vehicle, not even to read its parameters. Freeing space on the Pi stays a
> deliberate act in BlueOS's own interface. A test walks every call that touches
> the vehicle and asserts the method was GET every time; the token File Browser
> hands out carries create, modify and delete rights, and nothing here uses
> them. A bug that destroys the only copy of a dive is the one failure this
> programme must not have.

The API is **discovered, not assumed**. BlueOS moves between releases and
extensions register themselves at runtime, so the probe walks what the vehicle
actually offers and reports it. Run it beside a vehicle and send the report on:

```
Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe --probe-rov report.txt
```

### The vehicle, by name

Connect returns **every** address that answers, each with the name it calls
itself, and every report leads with the name rather than the address. That is
not decoration. On one dock day Nereo on the tether and a fixed camera on the
wifi both answered to the hostname `blueos`, and whichever replied first won —
nothing downstream would have noticed, because it listed recordings, they looked
plausible, and they were the wrong vehicle's.

### Before the dive

Four things worth knowing while the ROV is still on deck. A recorder that fills
mid-transect does not warn anyone: it stops.

| Checked | Why it is on this screen |
|---|---|
| **Free space**, against the minutes you plan to record | The one that ends a dive early, and the one nobody thinks to look at. |
| **SoC temperature**, with its high-water mark | Throttling starts near 80 °C. One vehicle measured 55 °C sitting idle with a 59.9 °C peak — comfortable, but only because it was measured. |
| **Throttle events** already in the Pi's own log | Whether it has *been* throttling, which the current temperature does not tell you. |
| **Clock skew** against this laptop | See below. |

**The Pi's clock can be days wrong, silently.** It has no battery-backed clock,
so it restores the last time it knew at boot and stays there. One backup vehicle
was found **8.09 days behind**, sitting exactly on the date of its last flight.
Recordings are stamped with that clock and their filenames come from it, so a
dive flown in that state files under the wrong date and can collide with a real
earlier flight. This matters most on the spare vehicle — the one that sits
unpowered for weeks and then gets pressed into service. The skew corrected
itself to −6 seconds while the operator had the BlueOS web interface open, which
appears to be what syncs it, so the check reports the number and says plainly
what a large one means.

### Which recordings, and where they go

Recordings are listed by their **recorded span**, not their modification time,
and each is labelled with the transects it covers. The span comes from the
file's first 96 KiB over an HTTP range request — about 75 ms per file against
the minutes a full download costs. All 26 recordings on one vehicle resolved
their spans in half a second, and the estimated end time landed within two
seconds of the file's own timestamp.

Writing **straight to a portable SSD** is the point of the destination half. The
workflow it replaces crosses a marginal network twice: Pi to laptop, laptop to
Dropbox over a MiFi hotspot, then down again onto a different machine. It also
works on the days the hotspot does not.

The destination is checked **before** anything is fetched, and files are
verified **after** they land:

* **FAT32 cannot hold a recording of 4 GiB or more**, however much room the
  drive reports free — two of this programme's own recordings are past it
  (4.94 and 4.41 GiB). The failure presents as a permissions problem rather
  than a size one, which is exactly how it turned up in the field.
* Free space, file system and writability are all settled first, leaving 512 MB
  of headroom rather than filling a volume to the last byte.
* Each file is checked by size and by reading its header back. A copy that ran
  out of drive halfway is worse than one that never started, because it looks
  finished.

The drive is laid out as `flights/<date>_<site>/logs`, so it drops straight into
Dropbox later.

### A snapshot of what the vehicle was

**Save a snapshot** writes `logs/vehicle_snapshot.json` into the flight's own
folder, so it travels with the data. Behaviour has already changed underneath
this programme twice — the recorder's repair sweep rewriting old files, and a
BlueOS beta — and tying a data anomaly to a version change is straightforward
with this and close to impossible without it.

It records BlueOS, ArduSub and its vehicle type, the flight-controller board,
every installed extension with its tag and whether it is enabled, and the
running containers with their image tags — which is not the same question, since
an extension can be updated and not restarted. Plus disk, temperature, throttle
history and clock skew at dive time. Against a live vehicle: 12 seconds, 42 KiB.

**The parameters come from the autopilot's own flight log, not from asking the
vehicle.** Asking would mean sending `PARAM_REQUEST_LIST` — a write to the
vehicle bus. ArduPilot writes the complete parameter set into the head of every
dataflash log it keeps, so a GET reads it instead, and that turns out to be the
better source on every count:

* it is the set **as flown** for a given flight, not as currently configured;
* it is **retrospective** — one vehicle was holding 80 logs going back to 2025,
  so "what did we change, and when?" is answerable for flights that happened
  long before this code existed;
* it is **cheap**: the block sits at the head, so 512 KiB and a third of a
  second gets all 1,014 parameters, against 78 MB for the largest whole log.

The snapshot also carries what this flight changed from the one before it. On
one vehicle that immediately distinguished two kinds of change: log 79 to 80
moved eleven values — stream rates, barometer ground pressure — while 78 to 79
moved 279 with parameters appearing and disappearing, which is the signature of
a firmware change rather than somebody turning a knob. An absent parameter is
reported as `null` rather than unchanged, on purpose, so those two cases cannot
be confused.

> A folder can also stand in as the source — a mounted share, or last dive's
> logs — so the selection and verification path is usable without a vehicle
> present.

---

## Monitoring: the topside, while it flies

BlueOS records the vehicle. Nothing recorded the machine on the other end of the
tether — and that machine is a field laptop in a case, in the sun, running a
video client. The two topside failures this programme has actually had were a
laptop too hot to hold its clock up and a tether link that went quiet, and
neither left a trace in any log that existed.

The **Monitoring** tool, in chapter 1 beside the vehicle, writes one row a
second for the length of a flight, and shows it while it happens.

### It starts and stops itself

Arming is the trigger. The pilot arms to fly and disarms when they are done;
that is already the truth of when a flight happened, recorded by the autopilot,
and asking someone to *also* press a button here would mean the record is
missing on exactly the busy days it matters most. The arm bit is read from the
HEARTBEAT that `mavlink2rest` already holds, so watching it is one small GET
every two seconds and sends the vehicle nothing.

Two behaviours follow from what actually happens on a boat:

* **A brief disarm does not end a flight.** A surface interval between
  transects, a bump of the switch, a failsafe that trips and clears — ending on
  the first disarm would cut one dive into four files with four sets of
  parameters, none of which answers *what was set on that dive?* A disarm opens
  a 90-second grace period; re-arming inside it carries on the same recording,
  and the gap is written into the companion file rather than hidden.
* **A dropped request is not a disarm.** The tether drops packets — measured
  doing so on 2026-09-11, in bursts of three or four, confirmed against
  `ping.exe` running at the same time. An unanswered question reads as *unknown*
  and never closes a flight.

If no flight folder has been chosen, nothing is recorded and the page says so in
as many words. That is deliberate: guessing a folder means a flight filed
somewhere nobody looks.

### What it records

71 columns at 1 Hz, in the eight groups the page shows one at a time: CPU,
memory, GPU and video, storage, the Ethernet link and the round trip to the
vehicle, the Cockpit process group, power and temperature, and [the tether
itself](#the-tether-from-both-ends). The vehicle's own arm state, HTTP round
trip and Pi temperature ride along in the same row, so correlating the two does
not mean joining two files on two clocks.

A sample costs **about 15 ms** on the Latitude 5420 Rugged this was written for
— 1.5% of its one-second budget. Getting there took moving two readings off the
sample path: the battery's discharge rate is a WMI query at 59 ms (and seen at
148), and enumerating adapter stats is 19, so both now run on a thread of their
own and the sample reads what they last left behind.

**The schema does not move.** Every column is written whether or not this
machine can fill it, so two flights from two laptops read into one data frame. A
reading this laptop has no sensor for is left **blank, never `FALSE`** — a fan
column reading FALSE would say the fan had stopped, where blank says nobody
knows. What is blank and why is written beside the CSV, once per flight:

| not readable on a Latitude 5420 Rugged | why |
|---|---|
| CPU package and core temperature, package power | Windows publishes core sensors only to a signed driver or an elevated WMI read |
| GPU temperature, power, throttle flag | integrated Intel graphics publish no such sensor |
| SSD temperature | the storage reliability counters need administrator |
| fan speed, battery temperature | this chassis publishes neither without Dell Command &#124; Monitor |

What *is* readable covers the question that prompted this. `motherboard_temp_c`
is the ACPI thermal zone — the chassis, which is what moves when a laptop sits
in the sun — alongside its throttle reasons and passive-cooling limit.
`cpu_frequency_mhz` is the real clock, `Processor Frequency` times `% Processor
Performance`, and it is the number that falls when the package is power-limited:
this laptop bursts to 2,470 MHz and settles at 1,815 under sustained load.

### The tether, from both ends

A September flight disarmed the vehicle five times in twenty-five minutes.
Every one of the broken recordings ended within a second of the same two
autopilot messages — `MYGCS: 255, heartbeat lost`, then `Lost manual control` —
which is ArduSub's ground-station failsafe: the topside stopped heartbeating for
three seconds, so the vehicle disarmed itself.

The 1 Hz row above proved the laptop was not the problem. It could not say what
was, and the gaps were structural rather than a matter of adding columns.

* **The failsafe is three seconds long.** A one-second sampler puts a
  one-second error bar on a three-second event, which is not enough to order
  the link going quiet and the client going quiet.
* **It measured one interface, and that interface was a bridge.** The tether
  arrives on a Windows network bridge, so `ethernet_connected` was the bridge
  miniport's — a software device that reports itself connected at 100 Mbps for
  as long as it exists, whatever the adapter underneath it is doing. A dropped
  cable and a bridge that has stopped forwarding wrote the same healthy row.
* **It reduced the ping to a rolling percentage.** That says something is wrong
  thirty seconds after it started and never says which packet was the first to
  go.

Three things now run beside it. None of them can slow the 1 Hz recorder down or
stop a flight being recorded: each is on its own threads, every reading is
optional, and a station that cannot take one writes a blank.

#### Eight more columns in the same row

| column | what it settles |
|---|---|
| `nic_carrier`, `nic_low_power` | the routing interface's carrier as the *driver* reports it, and whether NDIS has it in a low-power state — the reading a laptop on battery leaves nowhere else |
| `phy_carrier`, `phy_rx_bytes` | the physical adapter underneath a bridge. Blank when the routing interface is itself physical. **`phy_rx_bytes` still climbing while the bridge has gone quiet means the bridge stopped forwarding, not that the tether dropped** |
| `rov_arp_ok` | whether layer 2 still resolves the vehicle. A lost ARP entry and a lost route look identical to a ping |
| `pi_eth_rx_bytes`, `pi_eth_rx_errors` | the vehicle's own count of what arrived on its Ethernet port. Cumulative, so the reading taken when a link returns says how much got through while the topside could see nothing |
| `tether_link_mbps` | the rate the two Fathom-X boards have negotiated with each other, when the tether diagnostics extension is installed to report it |

The last two rows are the ones worth having. A Fathom-X pair keeps both its
Ethernet sides up at 100 Mbps whatever the powerline side is doing, which is
exactly why a tether that has lost sync looks healthy from both computers — and
`pi_eth_rx_bytes` flat across a blackout says the topside's frames never
arrived, while a counter that kept climbing says they did and the fault is on
the way back.

#### A fast trace, at ten hertz

Three narrow files per flight, beside the wide one:

```
network_fast_<flight>.csv     every watched interface's counters, 10 Hz
network_pings_<flight>.csv    one row per ICMP echo, 5 Hz, with its status code
network_events_<flight>.txt   the transitions, in the order they happened
network_trace_<flight>.json   what was watched, and every event, as data
```

The fast file carries the bridge **and** the adapter under it side by side, so
the comparison that settles the question is two columns rather than an argument.
Counters are written cumulative rather than as rates: a rate computed at the
point of measurement hides the counter it came from, and a missed tick lands as
a visible jump instead of a plausible average.

The ping file keeps the API's **status code**, not just a hit or a miss.
`request timed out` is a packet that went out and never came back;
`destination host unreachable` is the local stack saying it could not send one
at all, which is what a lost ARP entry looks like. A log that records both as
"no answer" throws that distinction away.

A tick costs 1.4 ms — one `GetIfTable2` call, with only the wanted rows turned
into objects. Reading all 55 interfaces on the station this was written for
costs 6.4, which is why the sampling path does not.

**Ten hertz is a claim about this module, not about the network driver.**
Whether the counters *move* that fast is a property of the adapter, so it is
measured rather than asserted: every trace reports `counter_granularity`, the
share of ticks on which each interface's receive counter actually changed. Near
1 means the driver keeps up and the sub-second detail is real. Near 0.1 on a
link known to be carrying video means the driver updates about once a second and
the extra ticks are copies — worth knowing before someone reads a 100 ms figure
off the file and believes it.

#### The check to run before the dive

*Check the network*, on the Monitoring page, or without opening the application:

```
Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe --netcheck report.txt
```

It reports every adapter with its carrier, link speed, MTU, error and discard
counts, which one holds the vehicle's subnet, whether that one is a bridge and
what is underneath it — and the settings that cannot be recovered afterwards
from a log that never recorded them:

```
> Network Bridge
    MAC Bridge Miniport
    state up | carrier connected | 100 Mbps | mtu 1500
    address 192.168.2.1/255.255.255.0
- Ethernet 2
    Realtek USB GbE Family Controller
    state up | carrier connected | 100 Mbps | mtu 1500
    power management: 256 - Windows MAY power this adapter down to save energy
    energy efficient ethernet: 1
```

`PnPCapabilities` is the "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save
power" checkbox, stored inverted: only bit `0x18` forbids Windows from powering
the adapter down, so the common values — absent, `0`, `256` — all mean it may.
On a laptop that spends a flight on battery, that is the setting worth reading
before the dive rather than after it.

Each flight also writes `network_topside_<flight>.txt` when it opens, so a
configuration that changed between two flights is a diff rather than a memory,
and the flight's JSON carries **Windows' own adapter events** over the dive. An
empty list there is itself a finding: a carrier that never dropped leaves no
event, so an outage with nothing behind it was not the cable coming out.

*Measure the link* runs the same sampling for four seconds against a live
tether and reports what it actually resolved — how fast each counter moved, the
throughput it saw, and the round trips over the same window. Four seconds on
deck, and it answers "is ten hertz worth it on this laptop" with a measurement.

### Parameters and versions, before and after

Arming takes a snapshot of the vehicle; disarming takes another and writes the
difference.

* `params_*.json` — every parameter as it stood at disarming, 1,014 of them.
* `delta_params_*.json` and `.txt` — what moved during the flight, with the
  value before and the value after. The `.txt` is a table to read on deck.
* `versions_*.json`, `delta_versions_*.json` and `.txt` — the same for BlueOS,
  ArduSub, the board, and every extension and container.

The parameters come from the autopilot's own dataflash log, read **whole**
rather than just its head. The head carries the block ArduPilot writes when a
log opens; a parameter changed later in the flight is its own PARM record
further in, and reading only the first 512 KiB would miss exactly the changes
worth recording. Taking the last value of each name gives the set as it stood
when the log was read. It stays a GET: nothing is sent to the vehicle.

Measured against Nereo: a 16.7 MB log came down in 2.0 s at 8.2 MB/s and parsed
in 0.2 s; the live 1,014-parameter set reads in 1.6 s.

**Changes the autopilot makes itself are listed apart.** Barometer ground
pressure is re-zeroed at every arming and the statistics counters tick on their
own — all three turned up in the first real log this was tested against. Left
in the main list, every flight would look as though something had been changed,
and the one flight where something actually was would look identical to all the
others.

### Watching it happen

One strip per reading in the chosen group, each on its own scale with its
current value beside it and the range it is scaled to at the right.

Separate scales because shared ones were useless: in the memory group alone the
values run from 1.2 (pagefile percent) to 700 (pages per second), so six of the
seven series were flat lines along the bottom while one filled the frame. What
this is for is comparing *shapes* — did the frequency drop when the temperature
rose — and shapes survive separate scales.

Drawn on a Tk canvas rather than with a plotting library, and decimated to the
strip's pixel width before drawing, so an hour of data costs what a minute does.
Nothing on the page drives the recording: closing it, or never opening it,
changes nothing about what is written — which matters, because the operator is
flying.

## The flight, and its transects

The first tool in chapter 1, and the one everything downstream is named from.
Two steps: say which folder this dive lives in, then write down its transect
times — once.

### The flight folder

Point the app at the folder for one dive. The expected layout is:

```
2026_08_24_Centennial/
    logs/                 recorder_*.mcap
    photos/
    videos/
        downward/         GoPro MP4s   <- composited
        forward/          GoPro MP4s   <- ignored
```

Older layouts (`video/`, `downward/video/`, mcaps loose in the root) are
recognised too. Whatever it finds is listed in the panel — **read it before
running.** Compositing the wrong camera is an expensive mistake to discover an
hour into an encode, so discovery reports rather than assumes.

Several mcaps per flight is normal (BlueOS rolls a new file each time recording
restarts); they are merged onto one timeline in chronological order.

### Sites and transects

Add a site (name, project, date), then its transects. Times are **TC-25** —
the clock the GoPro displays after a
[GoPro Labs precision time](https://gopro.github.io/labs/control/precisiontime/)
sync, as written down in the field. `hh:mm:ss`; the duration is shown as you
type, and obviously wrong entries are flagged.

Multiple sites per flight folder are supported.

Entries are saved to `surveys.json` in the flight folder and reloaded
automatically next time, so a re-run at a different resolution needs no retyping.
Flight folders written before the rename still carry `utc_plan.json`; those are
read as they stand, so nothing on disk has to move.

**Check them before anything is processed.** *Draw the dive profile* reads the
flight's depth against time and shades the transect windows onto it. Every band
should sit on a flat stretch of seabed; one that lands on a descent, an ascent
or a surface interval is a time typed wrong, and this is the last cheap moment
to find that out — before imagery is filed and a card is wiped.

## The flight report

*Flight summary*, the first tool in chapter 2, and the one to open when the
boat is back on the trailer. It reads everything the flight wrote, works out
what happened, and writes a PDF that travels with the flight folder.

```
Underwater-Telemetry-Compositing.exe "D:/flights/2026_09_11_OTS" --report
```

A 5 GB day takes about a minute, almost all of it reading the recordings. The
sheet itself draws in under two seconds. Nothing touches the vehicle and no
recording is modified — by the time anyone opens this the ROV is on deck, so
unlike the monitoring page it is free to use the whole laptop.

### What it works out

The analysis after the 11 September flight took an evening and produced
something a colleague could read in two minutes. The two minutes were the
valuable part, so the evening is now a function:

* **Every recording's ending is matched to why it ended.** A recording is one
  armed period — the BlueOS recorder writes only while armed — so "why are
  there five files" is always really "what disarmed the vehicle five times".
  The autopilot's own `STATUSTEXT` says which of them were ground-station
  failsafes, and the topside row says whether the link had already gone.
* **The two are put side by side.** The seconds between the link going quiet
  and the vehicle noticing is the measurement that separates *the link went
  and took the heartbeat with it* from *the client went quiet on a healthy
  link*. Both happened on 11 September and they need different fixes.
* **The laptop is ruled in or out.** CPU, memory, disk, GPU and adapter errors
  across the whole day, so "the laptop was fine" is a measurement.
* **The ground stations are compared**, when a day used two — link
  availability, failsafes and throughput each, over the whole time each was
  connected rather than only while it was recording. A client that keeps
  dropping the link disarms the vehicle *into the gaps between* its
  recordings, so crediting it only for its recordings reports it as the one
  that held the link best.
* **Sensor health comes from the transect extractor**, so the EKF's aiding
  sources, its innovation variances, the compass and the DVL are on the same
  sheet as the tether.

Each finding carries the timestamps and readings it came from. Where the logs
cannot settle something the finding says so — an outage in a flight that
predates the per-adapter columns reports that it *cannot* be placed, rather
than guessing.

### The page

Three rows on one clock — what was recording, whether the tether was alive,
which client was flying — with the disarms numbered across the top. Then every
finding with its evidence, then the systems: the ground-station comparison,
four small multiples shaded where the tether was down, and the vehicle,
parameter and topside records.

Drawn with matplotlib into a **vector** PDF, so the text is selectable and the
figure is sharp at any zoom. Montserrat is embedded from the fonts this
application already ships, so the sheet reads the same on a machine that has
never installed it. Colours, weights and hierarchy follow SAQ-001 through
`brand.py`; severity uses Coral rather than red, because the palette has a
warm accent and the guidelines ask that the brand's own colours do the work.

---

## One record per flight

The first version of the monitor wrote seven files per flight — thirty in an
afternoon of three. Reading the 11 September logs back showed four things
wrong, and the file count was the least of them.

**A failed read was written as a fact.** One snapshot was taken while the
tether was down. It recorded `blueos: ""` and `containers: []`, and the diff
against it reported **twenty extensions and containers removed during the
flight**, in capitals, in a file called `delta_versions`. Nothing was removed.
That is the same failure the 1 Hz row is careful to avoid — a dead instrument
must not look healthy — arriving through a different door.

**The parameter dump had no provenance.** `{"count": 1020, "parameters": {…}}`
and nothing else: no vehicle, no time, no firmware, no source log. A parameter
set that cannot say where it came from cannot be compared to another one,
which is the only thing anyone wants to do with it.

**The delta was all noise.** Every change in it was `set_by_autopilot` —
barometer ground pressure, boot count, flight time. The question being asked
is *did somebody turn a knob*, and the answer, none, was buried under five
entries that move on every flight.

**The numbers were float64 noise.** `0.30000001192092896` for a parameter the
autopilot holds as float32 `0.3`. Unreadable, and worse: two dumps of the same
value can differ in that tail and diff as a change.

So: one `flight_<id>.json`, and the tear-sheet as the thing a person reads.

| it carries | why |
|---|---|
| identity and timing | vehicle, host, board, firmware, computer, interface, started, ended, and why it ended |
| `parameters` | every value, with `read`, `taken`, `read_from` and `count` beside them. Values are the shortest decimal that is still the same float32 |
| `versions` | BlueOS, ArduSub, board, extensions and containers — or `read: false` and `why_absent`, never an empty vehicle |
| `changes` | **partitioned**: `parameters_by_operator` and `parameters_by_autopilot` in separate halves, so the question has its own answer |
| `since_previous_flight` | the same comparison against the last flight this vehicle recorded, found automatically |
| `monitor`, `network`, `brief_disarms` | what the CSVs beside it mean, and what the tether did |

Two refusals are built in. A version comparison against a snapshot that did
not read is **refused**, with the reason recorded. And a diff in which most of
the vehicle's software appears or disappears at once is refused too, because
extensions are installed one or two at a time by a person — that shape is a
snapshot that failed, and it can happen when the *opening* snapshot failed
while the closing one looks perfectly healthy.

`flightscan` still reads the old seven-file layout, so an existing flight
folder analyses without being rewritten.

### When the snapshots are taken

Still at arming and disarming, which is the right trigger: it is the truth of
when a flight happened, recorded by the autopilot, and it costs nobody a
button press. Two things changed around it.

The opening snapshot now starts **before** anything else the recorder does at
arming. Its whole value is being the vehicle *as it was at arming*, so every
millisecond between the two is a millisecond in which the "before" can become
the "after" — work queued ahead of it already cost this recorder a parameter
change it should have seen.

And the comparison that matters most is no longer the within-flight one. A
dive almost never changes a parameter; what does is the week between dives. So
each record also carries `since_previous_flight`, found by walking back
through the flight records in this folder and then across sibling flight
folders. That is the question a survey lead actually has before a dive: *is
this vehicle configured the way it was the last time it worked*.

## Transects and recording health

The rest of chapter 2: what the recordings say, and whether they can be
believed. Two tools, and a third report inside the first.

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| **Transects** | What the telemetry says — [one CSV per transect](#transects-mcap-to-csv), a map of the site, and [how the instruments behaved](#sensor-health). |
| **Recording health** | Whether the `.mcap` *file* is intact, [what to do when it is not](#when-a-recording-fails), and how to fall back to [the autopilot's own log](#reading-the-autopilots-own-log). |

### Transects (mcap to CSV)

The **Transects** page runs the extractor in [`mcap_to_csv/`](../mcap_to_csv/)
against the flight that is already open. It reads the survey plan from
*Flight & transects* and the recordings from the flight folder, so the transect windows are
typed once and drive both the CSVs and the video overlays — two copies of those
times drifting apart is the kind of error that only shows up when the analysis
disagrees with the footage.

It writes one CSV per transect plus a Leaflet map of the site. Column meanings
and provenance are in [COLUMNS.md](../mcap_to_csv/COLUMNS.md).

`run_UTC.bat` installs the extractor alongside UTC. If the page reports it
missing, install it by hand:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ../mcap_to_csv
```

---

## Photos

Chapter 3, three tools: bring it in, work it up, get it out.

### Import

One page covers both routes, because they are the same job with a different
source:

* a **GoPro card** — frames are *copied*, so the card keeps its originals until
  the operator chooses to reformat it;
* the flight's own `photos/GPR` and `photos/JPG` — frames are *moved*, because
  they are already inside the flight and a second copy is waste.

Which one applies is decided by **where the source sits, not by a toggle**, so
the safe behaviour cannot be switched off by accident. Frames are filed into
transect folders by their capture time against the survey plan, renamed so a raw
and its preview stay paired, and stamped with the telemetry banner. See
[Folder structure](#folder-structure) for the naming and for why `JPG_edited` is
never written to.

### Develop the raws

*Process photos* takes one folder of `.GPR` raws and produces delivery TIFs in a
`TIF` folder beside it — a **sibling, never a child**, so the exports are not
picked up by anything that scans the raw folder, including this feature's own
next run.

| Step | Setting | Why it is fixed |
|---|---|---|
| Crop | **4606 × 4030 px** | Fixed by the survey protocol, not by the camera. |
| Lens | chromatic aberration removed | — |
| Denoise | **AI Denoise, amount 50** | The protocol's value; the step that claims the machine. |
| Export | **16-bit ProPhoto RGB TIF** | Delivery format for downstream analysis. |

The recipe is **not adjustable**. Crop size, colour space and bit depth are set
by the survey protocol rather than by taste, so they are stated rather than
offered; the only two choices that change the outcome for an operator are
whether to run Denoise and what to do about TIFs that already exist.

**Check comes before Develop.** A run takes the machine away for the best part
of an hour, so nothing about it should be discoverable only by trying it. Check
reads the frame sizes, looks for Lightroom and measures the disk, and prints
what it found in the same box the run's problems appear in — by the time the
confirmation dialog opens, its numbers have been on screen once already.

Three things are worth knowing about how this is driven, because they are all
consequences of what Lightroom does and does not expose:

* **The crop arithmetic is pure, and tested on its own.** Lightroom stores a
  crop as four fractions of the uncropped frame, rounds to nearest, and writes
  six decimal places back to the catalog — so six is what the plan is computed
  against. A rectangle one pixel out is indistinguishable from a correct one
  until 179 TIFs have been written.
* **AI Denoise has no scripting interface**, and as of Lightroom Classic 14.5 no
  batch entry point either. A develop preset carrying a Denoise filter *looks*
  like a way to script it and is not: it sets the flag without computing
  anything, and the export comes out bit-identical to un-denoised. So UTC does
  what an operator does — develop one photo in the Detail panel, then Sync the
  settings across the folder: one panel interaction and one dialog, whatever the
  size of the batch.
* **Every step is verified against the catalog, not the screen.** Denoise writes
  a per-photo record and the run waits for it, so a click that appeared to work
  but did nothing is caught. Anything unreachable raises rather than quietly
  exporting un-denoised frames and calling it done, and each run dumps the
  control trees it walked, so a panel that has moved again names itself.

### Banner tools

The telemetry banner applied to any folder of stills, after the fact — for
imagery that was imported before a plan existed, or corrected and re-exported
later. It refuses to stamp a folder twice.

---

## Video

Chapter 4. Two jobs at very different speeds, deliberately on one page but
chosen separately:

* **Trim** is an ffmpeg stream copy — no re-encode, nothing lost, seconds per
  transect. It gives you the untouched 4K for exactly the survey window.
* **Composite** decodes, draws [the telemetry overlay](#what-a-composite-carries)
  and re-encodes. Minutes to hours.

Either can be run now or months later by pointing at a flight whose footage is
already in `videos/downward`, so a rushed field day can dump the card and leave
the slow work for a desk. Nothing is written to the source footage either way.

### What it writes

Tick any combination of 4K / 1080p / 720p. Videos land in
`videos/composites/`, named:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_project_site_transect_resolution.mp4
2026-08-24_HSIL_Centennial_T1_1080p.mp4
```

The 1 Hz CSV lands in `logs/`.

### How long it takes, and where the time goes

Measured on a 20-core laptop, one 10-minute transect (3,600 overlay frames):

| overlay workers | wall clock | frames/s | vs one core |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 613.8 s | 5.9 | — |
| 4 | 176.0 s | 20.5 | 3.5× |
| 8 | 158.6 s | 22.7 | 3.9× |
| 12 *(default)* | 115.7 s | 31.1 | **5.3×** |
| 16 | 103.3 s | 34.8 | 5.9× |

Drawing the overlay was the pipeline's only serial stretch — ffmpeg already
uses every core when it encodes, and the trims are stream copies bound by the
disk. Panels are now drawn across processes: telemetry is sampled and footers
formatted in the parent, so workers receive plain data and neither the
telemetry store nor the caller's footer callback has to be picklable.

The default leaves two cores free (capped at 12) because a run lasts tens of
minutes and the machine is normally still in use. Override with
`AppConfig.overlay_workers` or the `UTC_OVERLAY_WORKERS` environment variable.
Scaling is well short of linear — past a dozen workers, PNG compression and the
disk take over — so 16 buys little over 12 while making the laptop sluggish.

Sequences under 400 frames stay on one process: starting a pool costs more than
it saves. If a pool cannot start at all, the run falls back to one core and
says so rather than failing.

> Parallel and serial output is verified byte-identical, frame for frame — a
> composite must not depend on how many cores drew it.

**Trimming is deliberately not parallelised.** It is an ffmpeg stream copy: one
flight wrote 9.19 GB across three transects in about 24 seconds, roughly
400-500 MB/s, which is the disk's limit rather than the CPU's. Running them at
once would divide that bandwidth, not multiply it.

### While a run is going

A full flight is tens of minutes of encoding, so two things are worth knowing.

**Sleep.** Windows does not count a working process as user activity, so a
laptop left alone will idle-sleep mid-encode and the run pauses until it wakes.
On one test run that cost 55 minutes and looked exactly like a hang. The tool
now asks Windows to stay awake while it works. **Closing the lid still sleeps
the machine** — no program can override that — so leave the lid open on a long
run. The screen is allowed to switch off, which is fine.

**Files open elsewhere.** Outputs are written into a Dropbox folder, so
something else may be holding the file the tool is about to replace: Dropbox
uploading the previous version, antivirus, or Excel with the last run's CSV
still open. The tool waits for the lock to clear and says so. If it never
clears, it writes `…(1).mp4` alongside rather than throwing away the encode, and
tells you to close the other program.

### Short clips, and two flights side by side

Two more things on the Video page, both of which write into the flight rather
than out of it.

**A short clip from one video** — a lingcod for a talk, a holdfast for a post.
Deliberately a different job from a transect trim, and a different module:

| | Transect trim | Moment clip |
|---|---|---|
| what it is | **evidence** | **communication** |
| cut on | TC-25 clock time | offsets into one file (`6:40`) |
| encoding | stream copy, never re-encoded | re-encoded, so the cut lands on the frame asked for |
| lands in | `videos/transects/T*/` | `videos/clips/` |

Any combination of 1080p, 720p, a web-optimised "social" rendition, and an
animated GIF. The GIF is 480×270 at 10 fps and costs roughly 0.8 MB per second —
GIF stores every frame whole, so the tool reports the size afterwards and
suggests the MP4 instead when it has run away.

**Two videos side by side** answers a question the separate recordings cannot:
how much of the difference between two flights is the lighting rig and how much
is the seabed. Put one vehicle next to the other over the same site and the
comparison is direct.

Either side may be a video file *or* a folder of mcaps — the ROV's forward
camera — and the two need not match. The awkward part is time, because the
sources do not share a clock:

* an **mcap** carries an absolute epoch per frame, so a TC-25 time of day places
  it exactly;
* an **original GoPro chapter** carries a timecode track, so it does too;
* a **trim** carries its *source chapter's* timecode — every trim from one
  recording reports the same start — and a **composite** carries none at all.
  Neither can be placed on a clock, so both are addressed by offset into the
  file.

So each side gets its own in-point in whichever form suits it, and the two share
one duration. That is not a compromise: comparing one vehicle's T1 against
another's T5 means two different absolute times deliberately aligned from their
own starts, which a single shared timeline could not express. The reading rule
is the same as everywhere else in UTC — **three colon-separated fields is a time
of day** (`10:02:27`); anything shorter is an offset into the file (`1:30`,
`90`).

---

## How the clocks are tied together

Two independent mappings, which is what makes the result checkable:

**TC-25 → video.** Every GoPro MP4 carries the timecode of its first frame, so a
transect time maps to a position inside a chapter by subtraction. Exact, and
needs no timezone. A transect spanning a chapter boundary is rendered in parts
and joined.

**TC-25 → mcap.** The mcap is stamped in UTC epoch, so this needs the local UTC
offset. That is **derived from the flight date** (via the IANA zone, so PST/PDT
is handled) rather than typed in — a mistyped offset would look exactly like a
good run until someone noticed the depth readout disagreeing with the picture.

**The check.** The derived mapping is then verified against a signal both
recorders see: the ROV's own lights. They are ramped to full at the start of a
dive and back to zero before ascending, and the downward GoPro goes from
near-black to lit when that happens. If the timecode and the lights disagree by
more than a few seconds, the run reports it.

Two traps that check deliberately avoids:

* Brightness is *not* linear in light power — altitude above the seabed and
  scene albedo move it too. So it scores agreement between "GoPro is dark" and
  "lights are off", not a correlation of raw values.
* Near the surface the relationship inverts: the GoPro can be bright *while the
  lights are off*, which is exactly what makes a naive correlation lock onto the
  wrong answer.

The ROV's own forward camera is useless for this — its auto-gain is aggressive
enough that whole-frame brightness barely moves across a full lights-off
transition (72 → 83 on the 2026-08-21 flight).

If the camera was never synced, there is no timecode track and the app says so
rather than guessing.

---

## When a recording fails

**Arming the ROV starts a new `.mcap`; disarming closes it.** The filename is
the arm time in UTC, which is why a day's folder holds a file per arm/disarm
cycle, some of them seconds long. Verified against the autopilot's own arm
events on two flights: `recorder_20260901_161800.mcap` was created at the
09:18:00 arm to the second, and closed one second after the 09:30:40 disarm.

The corollary matters: **the close depends on the disarm arriving over
MAVLink.** Break that path and the recorder never closes the file. Both
failures we have seen are that, and the fix differs:

| symptom | cause | what UTC does |
|---|---|---|
| `.mcap` rejected as corrupt (`RecordLengthLimitExceeded`); the BIN stops at the same instant | power lost mid-dive — the recorder was killed before it could write its footer | **Reads it anyway.** A scan walks the record headers to find the last good byte, then feeds the file plus a synthetic footer to the reader. The recording is opened read-only and never modified. |
| `.mcap` runs long past the disarm and is truncated; the BIN keeps logging normally | the MAVLink router died — the vehicle flew on, but nothing reached the recorder | The mcap holds video but no telemetry for the rest of the dive. **Switch that flight to the `.BIN`** on *Recording health*. |

Which of the two it is takes seconds to tell: compare where the BIN ends
against where the mcap ends.

### Reading the autopilot's own log

The flight controller writes `.BIN` dataflash logs to its own storage,
independent of BlueOS and of the MAVLink router — so they survive exactly the
failure that empties an mcap. *Recording health* lists them, places them on the
wall clock, and can make one the flight's telemetry source; everything
downstream (banner, dive profile, overlay, CSV) then reads it without knowing
the difference. **"Back to mcap" undoes it**, and the mcaps are never written to.

Placing a BIN on the clock is the hard part, because `TimeUS` is only
microseconds since the autopilot booted and a submerged vehicle rarely has a
GPS fix. Two routes, in order of preference:

* **GPS**, when any fix was logged — week and millisecond give UTC directly.
* **An overlapping mcap.** MAVLink carries `time_boot_ms` stamped by the same
  autopilot that writes `TimeUS`, so a recording that overlaps the log pins the
  two clocks together — including a recording whose telemetry died partway,
  which is the case that matters.

Two things that alignment gets right, both learned the hard way:

* **Each recording is judged alone.** A day's folder holds several power
  cycles and every one restarts `time_boot_ms` at zero; pooling them produced
  an offset 25 minutes wrong that looked entirely plausible.
* **It refuses to vouch for itself without corroboration.** Which recording
  shares a BIN's boot session is decided by whether the two dive profiles agree
  on the autopilot's clock — an axis no choice of offset can fake. Below
  r = 0.98 the alignment is reported as unverified rather than used. A wrong
  offset files imagery into the wrong transect, which is worse than a blank.

## The two CSVs

UTC writes two different telemetry files, and it is worth knowing which is which
before opening one:

| File | Written by | Covers | Rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logs/<date>_<project>_telemetry_1Hz.csv` | **Video** (alongside the composites) | the whole flight, including surface time | one per second of the recording |
| `transects/<Transect_ID>.csv` | **Transects** | one transect each | one per second of that transect |

The flight CSV is the diagnostic record of the dive. The transect CSVs are the
analysis product: georeferenced, tide-standardised, and shaped to drop into the
VIAME and percent-cover joins.

---

## The flight telemetry CSV

One row per second across the whole recorded span, so descents, ascents and
between-transect manoeuvring stay in the record. Rows outside a transect are
labelled `off_transect`.

Columns: UTC and TC-25 time, date, project/site/transect, **power (V × A)**,
voltage, current, depth, altitude, pressure, water temperature, heading, roll,
pitch, yaw, ground speed, climb, NED velocity and position, GPS (lat/lon/alt/
fix/satellites — zero unless the USBL was running), EKF variances, DVL
confidence and per-beam ranges, vibration, light power, gain and camera tilt.

Values are held forward from the last sample — these are sampled states, not
continuous signals — but only up to a staleness limit. A DVL that drops out
leaves blanks rather than a flat line, so a dead sensor cannot look healthy.

---

## The transect CSV columns

What the **Transects** step writes: 44 columns, one row per second, local times
in US/Pacific. Grouped by what they are for — what and when, where, how it was
moving, how deep, what the camera saw, then power, pilot settings, and the raw
inputs behind the derived columns.

**Read the Origin column before trusting a figure.** It is the difference
between a measurement and an estimate:

| Origin | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Direct** | Read straight off one sensor, or reported by the autopilot. Unit conversion only. |
| **Fused** | The autopilot's EKF combined several sensors. Smoother than any one of them, and no longer traceable to a single instrument. |
| **Computed** | Derived from other columns. No new information — inherits the trustworthiness of its inputs. |
| **Calibrated** | Computed using a constant measured off the camera rig, not the vehicle. Wrong if the camera, lens or housing changes and the constant does not. |
| **Entered** | Typed in, or read from the survey plan. |
| **External** | From outside the vehicle — the NOAA tide station. |

<!-- /transect-columns -->

### Three things that catch people out

**The last four columns are diagnostics, not analysis.** `Relative_alt_m`,
`VFR_alt`, `NEDz` and `Pressure_abs_hPa` are the raw candidates `Depth` chooses
from, row by row; `Depth_Source` records which one answered. They are in the file
so a suspicious `Depth` can be checked against the alternatives — and that is not
hypothetical. On 2026-08-26 `VFR_alt` sat at a constant −0.61 m for a whole dive
that reached 17 m, and comparing it against `Relative_alt_m` is the only reason
that was caught. Use `Depth` (or `Depth_std`) for analysis.

**`NEDz` has the opposite sign** to everything else: positive-down, where
`Depth`, `Relative_alt_m` and `VFR_alt` are negative-down. It is also blank on
recordings that do not carry `LOCAL_POSITION_NED`, which is many of them.

**Do not sum `Area_m2`** to get ground covered. At survey speed that counts the
same patch of seabed once per second the ROV was over it, inflating the total by
orders of magnitude. Use mean `Width` × total `Distance`.

Full provenance for every column, including the per-second averaging rules and
the camera calibration constants, is in
[mcap_to_csv/COLUMNS.md](../mcap_to_csv/COLUMNS.md).

## Sensor health

Step 5 on the **Transects** page. The transect CSVs are only as good as the
navigation behind them, and a recording says a great deal about that if asked.

> Not to be confused with the **Recording health** screen, which asks whether the
> `.mcap` *file* is intact and repairable. This asks whether the *instruments*
> inside a readable recording were working.

It reports four things:

**Which aiding sources the EKF actually had.** The line to read first is
*absolute horizontal position*. If it says `NO -- dead reckoning only`, the
filter never accepted a GPS or USBL fix and every horizontal position in the
output came from the DVL: the transects are correct relative to one another, but
the whole set can sit off the true location and rotates with any compass error.

**Where each column's numbers came from**, and how each source behaved — sample
rate, value range, and the dropouts that leave holes. This is the same
precedence the extractor uses, so the source named here is the one that appears
in `Depth_Source` and `DVL_source`.

**Innovation variances.** How the filter reports it is fighting a sensor, before
anything visibly breaks. Below 1.0 it is accepting the reading; above, it is
rejecting or straining. `compass_variance` matters more than it looks — a yaw
error rotates the entire DVL track about its start point, and no amount of good
DVL data corrects for it.

**Sensor health, vibration, and the autopilot's own warnings**, then a short list
of what is actually worth acting on.

### Give it the transects

With a survey plan loaded, the report also measures each column *inside* each
transect, and judges its warnings on those alone. This matters more than it
sounds. A dive is mostly not transect:

| 2026-09-02 Jack Block Park | Whole dive | Inside the transects |
|---|---|---|
| Altitude dropouts | 638, worst **275 s** | worst **2.9–6.9 s** |
| Coverage | — | 88–94% |

85 minutes of recording held about 42 minutes of transect, so the whole-dive
figures were measuring the surface intervals between them and said nothing about
the data being analysed.

### One judgement is built in

Without GPS or a locked USBL, ArduSub reports the **AHRS** health bit unhealthy
for the entire dive. It means *"no absolute position"*, not *"the attitude
solution is broken"*. Raising that as a fault would fire on every survey the team
flies and teach everyone to ignore the list, so it is annotated instead — unless
the dive did have an absolute fix, where it is a real concern.

From a terminal, the same report:

```bash
python -m ccr_m2c --health logs/*.mcap --plan surveys.json
```

## Layout and appearance

The GUI follows the Seattle Aquarium visual identity (v1, Aug 2023): Montserrat
throughout, with a dark scheme on Fathom and a light scheme on White/Pumice with
Stone body copy. Both respect the guidelines' contrast rules. Toggle top-right.

Three things in `utc/gui/nav.py` are unusual for CustomTkinter, and all three
are there for the same reason — the rail is the roadmap, so it has to read like
one:

* **The four chapters are drawn, not stacked.** Tk has no rounded rectangle and
  no anti-aliasing, so each button is rendered with Pillow and placed as an
  image. That also buys exact control over type size, hover and the disabled
  state, and lets the banner's numbered roadmap wear the same colour as the
  chapter it points at.
* **Type colour is measured against its own fill**, so Seafoam takes dark type
  where Salish takes White. The palette in `theme.CHAPTER_COLOURS` can be
  swapped without anyone remembering to swap the type with it.
* **Sizes come from the rendered font, not from constants.** A laptop at 250%
  display scaling gets a rail sized for its own type. An earlier version
  hard-coded a row height and pushed the last chapter off the bottom of the rail
  on exactly such a machine.

Overlay geometry and colours live in `utc/config.py` (`Layout`), and the
panel contents in `PANEL_ROWS`.

---

## Notes on the source footage

* The GoPro is mounted inverted and carries a **−180° rotation flag**. Relying
  on ffmpeg's autorotate is a trap: it rotates the frames fed to the filter graph
  *and* copies the matrix onto the output, so a player rotates the finished
  composite a second time and everything — overlays included — appears upside
  down. We neutralise the input matrix and apply the rotation ourselves.
* Video is HEVC Main 10. The pipeline stays 10-bit for 4K and 1080p so the tonal
  range that shooting with Native white balance exists to preserve survives.
* Light power is **not** on servo 16. `SERVO_OUTPUT_RAW` carries only port 0 (the
  eight thrusters); light power is `NAMED_VALUE_FLOAT` / `Lights1`. In a
  dataflash log the same signal is `RCIN.C9` and camera tilt is `RCOU.C10`,
  confirmed against a flight carrying both (r = +0.97 and +0.94).
* **Altitude has no status field over MAVLink.** When the DVL loses bottom lock
  ArduPilot reports `RANGEFINDER.distance = 0.00`, which is not an altitude of
  zero. The dataflash log does carry a status, and shows those samples are
  `NoData` — about one in eight while flying a transect. Both readers now drop
  them, so the banner shows the last good value rather than a false 0.00 m.
* `BARO` in a dataflash log has **two instances**: `[0]` is the pressure inside
  the electronics tube (~89 kPa, reads as +15 m of altitude) and `[1]` is the
  water sensor. Read together they correlate with nothing. Depth is
  `-CTUN.Alt`, `-POS.RelHomeAlt`, or `-BARO[1].Alt`.
* Dataflash logs angles in **degrees**; MAVLink uses **radians**.
* The mcap's `log_time` is written in bursts and is *not* the video frame time —
  that lives inside each `foxglove.CompressedVideo` message.
* The ROV camera stream is strongly variable-rate, which makes it unreliable to
  seek (asking for 465.259 s can return the frame at 466.708 s). It is therefore
  resampled once per flight to a constant-rate proxy.

Caching: intermediates go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\utc_cache\` (an existing
`ccr_composite_cache\` from before the rename is reused rather than rebuilt),
deliberately **outside** the flight folder so Dropbox does not sync disposable
working files to the whole team. Budget generously — a 5.3 GB recording
produced ~12 GB of intermediates (raw H.264, muxed proxy, constant-rate proxy,
telemetry CSV, overlay frames). A second run skips straight to compositing.
Delete that folder to force a rebuild.

## Tests

```
pytest                  the automated suite: hermetic, no flight data, seconds
pytest --runlive        also the scripts needing real flights or a display
ruff check utc tests    lint
```

Both run in CI on every push and pull request (`.github/workflows/utc-ci.yml`,
Python 3.11 and 3.13), which also builds the executable.

The suite is hermetic by design — it builds its own mcaps, breaks them the same
way a real recorder does, and synthesises dataflash messages, so none of it
needs a flight folder. The files that *do* need real data or a screen
(`*_live.py`, `debug_*`, the visual renderers, the GUI smoke test) are skipped
unless `--runlive` is given; collecting them on a machine without the data cost
about ninety seconds and then failed for reasons unrelated to the change.

Worth knowing which test guards what, since several exist because something
went wrong in the field:

| file | what it protects |
|---|---|
| `test_survey.py` | TC-25 parsing, DST, midnight-crossing transects, chapter spanning. Also that a missing timezone database **raises** rather than silently returning a time eight hours wrong. |
| `test_mcap_recovery.py` | Reading a recording the vehicle never closed, without modifying it. |
| `test_binlog.py` | The dataflash reader: barometer instances, degrees vs radians, a lost bottom lock that is not an altitude of zero, and refusing an unverified clock. |
| `test_photos.py` | The banner is never written twice, orientation is baked correctly, and an already-bannered folder says so plainly. |
| `test_fsutil.py` | Publishing over files locked by Excel or Dropbox. |
| `test_timeentry.py` | The six-keystroke time field, against a real Tk widget. |
| `test_blueos.py` | The vehicle client, against a small fake BlueOS: the probe never raises, reports honestly when it cannot reach a vehicle, and — walked call by call — **never uses anything but GET**. |
| `test_netdiag.py` | The tether diagnosis: that a subnet match finds the right adapter, that a bridge's members are watched even though nothing routes over them and are never dropped once watched, that two adapters cannot silently share a counter column, that the power-management bitmask is read the right way round, and that the vehicle's own counters survive BlueOS renaming them. |
| `test_rovfetch.py` | A thumb drive that refuses a 4.94 GiB file while reporting space free; a recording that looks current because its modification time was rewritten; a copy that ran out of drive halfway. |
| `test_sidebyside.py` | How a time is read, and the refusal of a timecode that cannot be trusted. Getting this wrong cuts the wrong ninety seconds silently. |
| `test_lightroom.py` | The crop arithmetic — the one number the RAW develop turns on — and the catalog poller, against a SQLite fixture carrying the subset of Lightroom's schema it joins on. |
