"""
One flight, recorded from arming to disarming, without anyone pressing a button.

What this writes into a flight's ``logs`` folder, per flight:

===========================  ==================================================
``laptop_monitor_*.csv``     the topside at 1 Hz, one row a second
``laptop_monitor_*.json``    what those columns mean and which this machine
                             could actually fill
``params_*.json``            every autopilot parameter as it stood at disarming
``delta_params_*.json/txt``  the ones that moved during the flight, with the
                             value before and the value after
``versions_*.json``          BlueOS, ArduSub, the board and every extension
``delta_versions_*.json/txt``  the ones that moved during the flight
===========================  ==================================================

**Arming is the trigger, not a button.** The pilot arms to fly and disarms when
they are done; that is already the truth of when a flight happened, recorded by
the autopilot. Asking someone to also press Start here would mean the record is
missing on exactly the busy days it matters most. Arm state is read from the
HEARTBEAT mavlink2rest already holds, so watching it costs one small GET every
couple of seconds and sends the vehicle nothing.

**A brief disarm does not end a flight.** Sitting on the surface between
transects, a bump of the arm switch, a failsafe that trips and clears -- all of
these disarm the vehicle without the dive being over. Ending the flight on the
first disarm would cut one dive into four files with four sets of parameters,
none of which answers "what was set on that dive?". So a disarm opens a grace
period, and only its expiry closes the flight. Re-arming inside it carries on
the same recording, and the gap is noted in the companion file rather than
hidden.

**A dropped request is not a disarm.** `read_arm_state` returns None when it
cannot tell, and None never ends a flight. The tether drops packets -- this
programme has measured it doing so -- and a recorder that stopped on one lost
GET would stop mid-transect.

**Nothing here can fail a flight.** Every write is best-effort and every read is
wrapped. The worst outcome is a missing column or a missing file, never a
traceback in front of someone flying an ROV.
