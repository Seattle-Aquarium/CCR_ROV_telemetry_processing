"""
Everything a flight left behind, gathered and put on one clock.

A survey afternoon writes into `logs/` from four independent recorders that do
not know about each other: the vehicle's own `.mcap` (one file per armed
period), the topside 1 Hz row, the 10 Hz network trace, and the parameter and
version snapshots taken at the flight's edges. Each is written in its own
units, on its own cadence, named by its own idea of the flight.

Reading them together by hand is the work this module removes. It does three
things and nothing else:

  **Find.** Group the folder's files by the flight they belong to, tolerating
  the fact that the naming has changed once already and will change again.

  **Reduce.** Turn each file into the smallest summary that still answers a
  question -- an `.mcap` into its armed span and its autopilot messages, a
  1 Hz CSV into its runs of good and bad link, a ping log into its outages.
  A 4.2 GB recording becomes about two kilobytes.

  **Align.** Put every one of those on UTC seconds, so the disarm the vehicle
  recorded and the blackout the laptop recorded can be compared rather than
  guessed at.

**No interpretation happens here.** Nothing in this module decides that
anything went wrong; it reports spans, counts and messages. What those mean is
`flightreport`'s job, and keeping the two apart means a disagreement about
interpretation never requires re-reading five gigabytes.

Two properties are deliberate. It never modifies a file -- a recording that
took a day to make must not be at risk from a program that only wants to look
at it. And every reader is individually optional: a folder with no network
trace, or an `.mcap` the vehicle never closed, yields a report with that part
missing rather than an exception.
