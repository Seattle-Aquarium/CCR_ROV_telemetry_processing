"""
Talking to BlueOS on the ROV's Raspberry Pi.

The point is to stop choosing recordings by hand. Three separate field
failures came from that: a flight whose covering recording was never
downloaded, a 6.7 GB file from a previous day pulled in because BlueOS had
rewritten its modification time, and a stray recording from six weeks earlier
sitting in a folder. UTC already knows the transect times and can read an
mcap's true span in under a second, so it can pick the right files itself.

**Everything here is read-only.** GET requests only, no deletes, no writes to
the vehicle. Freeing space on the Pi stays a deliberate act in BlueOS's own
interface: a bug here must never be able to destroy the only copy of a dive.

The API is *discovered*, not assumed. BlueOS moves between releases and
extensions register themselves at runtime, so `probe()` walks what the vehicle
actually offers and reports it. Building against a guessed endpoint is how you
get a tool that works on one vehicle and not the next.

#  the recordings: listing, spans, and fetching
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Confirmed against a live vehicle on 2026-09-08 (BlueOS 1.5.0-beta.34,
# ArduSub 4.5.7, Raspberry Pi 4 B). Three things were established there and
# each of them shapes what follows.
#
# **The recorder extension will not serve an mcap.** Its /recorder/files lists
# only the MP4s it has extracted, and asking it for an .mcap is refused
# outright: "Only .mp4 recordings are supported." So the recordings themselves
# have to come from somewhere else.
#
# **File Browser serves them, and hands out a token to anyone who asks.** A
# plain GET to /api/login -- no credentials -- returns a JWT with create,
# modify and delete permissions. Nothing here ever uses those: this module
# issues GETs and nothing else, and `verify_read_only` exists so that is a
# checked property rather than a promise.
#
# **Range requests work**, which is the one that matters. A recording's true
# recorded span can be read from its first kilobytes -- about 96 KiB and 75
# milliseconds per file -- instead of downloading 350 MB to find out. Judging
# recordings on their span rather than their name or their modification time
# is the whole point of this feature, and it is only affordable because of
# this.
