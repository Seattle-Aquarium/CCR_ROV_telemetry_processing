"""
Copying recordings off the ROV onto a drive you can carry home.

The field workflow this replaces is the slow one: download from the Pi to the
laptop, upload to Dropbox over a MiFi hotspot, then download again onto a
different machine. Every gigabyte crosses a marginal network twice. Writing
straight to a portable drive removes both hops, and works on the days the
hotspot does not.

Three things this is careful about.

**The destination is checked before anything is fetched.** A recording of five
gigabytes cannot be written to a FAT32 volume at all -- the limit is four, and
the failure looks like a permissions problem rather than a size one, which is
exactly how it presented in the field. Free space, the file system, and
whether the drive is even writable are all settled first.

**Files are verified after they land**, by size and by reading the header
back. A copy that ran out of drive halfway is worse than one that never
started, because it looks finished.

**Nothing on the vehicle is ever changed.** Fetching is a read. Freeing space
on the Pi stays a deliberate act in BlueOS's own interface.

The fetch itself takes an `opener` -- anything that turns a recording into a
readable stream. That keeps this testable against a folder on disk now, and
lets the BlueOS transport drop in once the probe has said what the vehicle
actually serves.
