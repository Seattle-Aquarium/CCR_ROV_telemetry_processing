"""
The Windows readings that psutil does not offer, and nothing else.

Everything platform-specific about laptop monitoring is in this one file so
that `laptop.py` above it reads as a list of measurements rather than as a
tour of the Win32 API. Three mechanisms live here:

  * **PDH** (`pdh.dll`) for the performance counters — GPU engines, the ACPI
    thermal zone, disk queue depth, commit charge, and the processor's actual
    clock. Counters are opened once and read on a timer; a sample costs
    microseconds, which is what makes 1 Hz logging free rather than a job.
  * **ICMP** (`iphlpapi.dll`) for the round trip to the vehicle. The IP Helper
    API answers without administrator rights, where a raw socket would not,
    and without spawning `ping.exe` once a second.
  * **WMI**, reluctantly and rarely, for the battery's discharge rate — the
    only reading here with no counter behind it. It is polled on its own slow
    cadence because a WMI query costs tens of milliseconds.

**Nothing here is required.** Every reading is optional and every failure is
silent by design: a laptop with no battery, an integrated GPU with no
temperature sensor, or a Windows build with a counter missing must produce a
row with a blank in it, never an exception that stops a flight being recorded.
`capabilities()` reports what actually answered on this machine, so a blank
column can be explained rather than guessed at.

Counters are added with `PdhAddEnglishCounterW` rather than `PdhAddCounterW`:
counter names are localised, and a laptop set to another display language
would otherwise find none of them.
