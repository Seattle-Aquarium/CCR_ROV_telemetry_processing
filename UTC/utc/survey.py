"""
Sites, transects, and the TC-25 timecode that ties them to the recordings.

Field workflow: the GoPro is synced with GoPro Labs precision time before a
dive, which sets the camera clock and stamps a timecode track into every MP4.
Transect start and end times are then written down by hand off the camera's
TC-25 display, as local wall-clock ``hh:mm:ss``.

Two independent mappings fall out of that:

  * **TC-25 -> video.** Each MP4 carries the timecode of its first frame, so a
    transect time maps to a position inside a chapter by simple subtraction.
    Exact, and needs no timezone at all.
  * **TC-25 -> mcap.** The mcap timestamps are UTC epoch, so this one needs the
    UTC offset that was in force locally. We derive it from the flight date via
    the IANA zone rather than asking the user, then check it against the ROV's
    own lights (see sync.py). Deriving-and-verifying beats asking, because a
    mistyped offset would look exactly like a good run until someone watched
    the video.

Transects may span a chapter boundary -- GoPro splits at ~11 GB, which is well
inside a long transect -- so video resolution returns a list of segments.
