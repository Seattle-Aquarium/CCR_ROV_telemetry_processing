# CCR ROV Survey Methods  

## 🌊 Overview  

This repository provides an overview of the Seattle Aquarium’s Coastal Climate Resilience (CCR) team’s remotely operated vehicle (ROV) survey workflow — spanning hardware configuration, field operations, telemetry data extraction, and visualization. It especially focuses on code and documentation for processing and organizing ROV telemetry data collected during benthic habitat surveys.

Our methods are designed for subtidal monitoring of nearshore habitats in the temperate waters of Puget Sound, where visibility and environmental conditions can be highly variable. Surveys are optimized to collect high-resolution, georeferenced imagery to support analyses of seafloor composition, kelp and algal cover, and associated benthic communities.

Our goal is to create an **open-source reference** that allows other research groups to understand, replicate, and adapt our methods for their own underwater survey applications.

## 🧮 Telemetry Processing  

### Underwater Telemetry Compositing (UTC)

A Windows desktop application that manages a survey flight end to end: it builds
the flight's folder structure, imports stills off the camera card into transect
folders, stamps MAVLink telemetry onto the imagery, trims and composites the
video, and exports a 1 Hz telemetry CSV.

**Collaborators need nothing installed.** It ships as a single ~96 MB
executable carrying its own Python runtime, ffmpeg, fonts and timezone
database — download, double-click, run. Windows 10/11, 64-bit.

It also reads recordings that failed in the field: an `.mcap` the vehicle never
closed (power lost mid-dive) is repaired on the fly without modifying the file,
and when the MAVLink router dies mid-flight the telemetry is recovered from the
autopilot's own `.BIN` dataflash log instead.

📁 [**`UTC/`**](UTC/) — see [`UTC/README.md`](UTC/README.md) for the workflow,
how the clocks are tied together, what every telemetry column means and where
it came from, and what to do when a recording fails.

### Code 

* `mcap_to_csv/`: **The current tool.** BlueOS 1.5 records telemetry as `.mcap` rather than writing `.tlog` files, so this replaces `tlog_to_csv.py` for new dives. Same transect windows, same per-second averaging, same output columns — the CSVs drop straight into the existing VIAME and percent-cover joins — plus a Leaflet map of every transect at the site. Run `run_MCAP_to_CSV.bat`, or build `MCAP-to-CSV.exe` from the included PyInstaller spec. See [mcap_to_csv/README.md](mcap_to_csv/README.md), which also documents what had to change: `LOCAL_POSITION_NED` is not in these recordings, so the DVL track is rebuilt from `VISION_POSITION_DELTA`.

* **Knowing what the numbers are worth.** Both the standalone tool and UTC's
  Transects step can report where each column's values actually came from and
  whether the instruments behind them behaved — which aiding sources the EKF
  had, its innovation variances, the compass, and the dropouts that leave holes
  in a transect. Run `python -m ccr_m2c --health logs/*.mcap --plan surveys.json`,
  or use step 5 on the Transects page. Column-by-column provenance is in
  [mcap_to_csv/COLUMNS.md](mcap_to_csv/COLUMNS.md).

* `tlog_to_csv.py`: This script processes `.tlog` files when GPS and DVL data are fused via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), producing more accurate tracks than using GPS or DVL alone. Instead of calculating `DVLlat`/`DVLlon`, this script incorporates the fused position data (`GLOBAL_POSITION_INT`) for improved accuracy. Kept for reprocessing dives recorded before the switch to `.mcap`.

</p>

* `transect_map.py`: This script generates a Leaflet map displaying the ROV tracks as measured by different navigation sources: GPS (black), DVL (blue), and EKF (red). `mcap_to_csv` builds its own map automatically; this one still serves CSVs produced by `tlog_to_csv.py`.
