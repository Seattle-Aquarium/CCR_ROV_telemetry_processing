# Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_telemetry_and_mapping
This is a private repository to organize information pertaining to the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of ROV telemetry and spatial data. 

### Overview

Mapping and spatial analyses comprise a large bulk of the analytical deliverables associated with our ROV development project. This in part stems from the *in situ* field methods we are developing â€“ current scientific SCUBA diver based benthic surveys (often) do not collect enough information to readily translate to the scale of maps. OR, even in instances where those diver-collected data could be mapped, often the researchers do not have the precise geospatial positioning required. Our project is designed to resolve both shortcomings. Our ROV and benthic survey methods will cover large swaths of seafloor (numerous back-to-back, 5m spaced, transects), collecting large amounts of information every step (every meter, every photo, every video still) of the way. And with our acoustic GPS system, we will have precise coordinates for the entirety of our benthic surveys. Uniting our various community structure and habitat data streams from the imagery with our GPS coordinates, and then overlaying / analyzing those ROV-derived variables in conjunction with existing habitat layers (e.g., bathymetry base layers, temperature, chlorophyll, canopy kelp cover imager, etc.) is our task. The challenge will be wrangling so many disparate data streams. The reward will be a rich landscape from which to ask MANY different types of research questions. Doing so has the potential to further both the *in situ* field methods and analytical approaches we use to evaluate and understand kelp-forest ecology and resilience.
