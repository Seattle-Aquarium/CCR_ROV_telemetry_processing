# Seattle_Aquarium_ROV_telemetry_and_mapping

## Overview

This is a private repository to organize information pertaining to the analysis and visualization of ROV telemetry and spatial data. Mapping and spatial analyses comprise a large bulk of the analytical deliverables associated with our Coastal Complexity & Resilience (CCR) program. This is because the ROV methods we are developing have the potential to provide novel insight, as we are able to survey large stretches of geospatially referenced seafloor. Our overarching objective is to unite the various community structure, benthic habitat, and satellite-derived data streams, along with ROV-derived telemetry information (e.g., GPS coordinates). This repository will provide a central location to store resources, links, code, figures, and hash out problems and discuss results (see "issues" at the top left of the repo webpage)
